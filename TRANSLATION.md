# Translation Guide

If you wish to translate Try Elixir into another language, please create a fork
and submit a pull request. Copy the files in `priv/static/tutorial/en` to a new
folder and begin translating. Code examples must remain untouched.

When you're done translating the tutorial files, add the new folder name to this
[line](https://github.com/tryelixir/tryelixir/blob/master/priv/static/js/tryelixir.js#L6)
in `priv/static/js/tryelixir.js`.
