<h3>Basics</h3>
<div class="highlight"><p>
We got back the number <code><span class="m">12</span></code> .
In interactive mode we can type an Elixir expression and get the result straight away.
</p>
<p>
Addition is not the only operation we can do with numbers, there's also subtraction, multiplication
and division. Try to type something like <code><span class="m">20</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="m">6</span></code> or <code><span class="m">6</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="m">3</span></code> . Floating point
division is done with the <code><span class="o">/</span></code> operator, for integer division use the function <code>div</code> .
</p>
<p>
Try typing <code><span class="m">12</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="m">3</span></code> and <code>div(<span class="m">12</span>, <span class="m">3</span>)</code> to see the difference.
</p></div>
